Twitter data using Tweepy library

![Mass Shooting data](/images/shooting_map.png)
Mass shooting: This map shows the occurrence of mass shootings in 2018 in the US.  Despite the fact that it's only the third month of 2018 there have been over hundreds of casualties throughout the US.  The fact that majority of the mass shootings have been situated in the eastern US may have some relation to the difference in legal policies between regions.

Heatmap: This map shows how NRA-related tweets are prevalent in densely populated areas.  It also shows that the eastern US has a much more disperse distribution of tweets compared to the west, which only mostly have clusters in the Seattle and California region.
